# ArchiWebos

As a web integrator, I worked on the development of an interior designer's portfolio site.
My job was to design the front-end of the site. Using my JavaScript skills, I managed to retrieve the architect's work from the API and integrate it into a dynamic gallery.
I also designed a secure login page to allow users to access the site's administration interface.
I implemented features to allow logged-in users to delete or add jobs without needing to reload the page. My work has considerably improved the user experience and made the site more interactive.
